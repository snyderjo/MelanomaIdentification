# MelnomaIdentification
I've created an initial CNN for identifying malignant skin lesions from a publicly available Kaggle data set.

I developed and implemented this model in Google Colab.

This is initially intended for my own erudition, with the hopes that I will be able to apply these methods in my profession.
